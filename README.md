## Project Summary

This project explores how technical skills and job titles influence salary trends. Using cleaned salary data from 2019–2025 and skill usage data from the 2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, I built regression models to forecast compensation for three roles:

- Data Scientist  
- Machine Learning Engineer  
- Data Analyst

I compared ARIMA, ETS, and Linear Regression models, and visualized top 5 skills per role to help HR teams with salary benchmarking and hiring strategy.

## Files Included
